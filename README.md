# Generic Gradebook
---

## Overview
---
As a high school teacher, I was constantly frustrated by the gradebook software provided to me. In addition, many of my colleagues struggled to figure out how to actually set up the grade calculation in a way they liked. My aim with this gradebook app is to make a simple, easy-to-use platform for teachers to enter and calculate grades, that does all the calculation for you, while still being easy to manipulate.
